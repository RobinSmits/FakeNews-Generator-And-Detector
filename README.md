# FakeNews-Generator-And-Detector

Recently I was experimenting with the T5 model and exploring the options it has to offer. Thinking about the Summarization capabilities of current State-of-the-Art NLP models I was curious to find out what the result could be if I would turn that around. So input a short text and let the model generate a longer text. If I would also use a News dataset for that than I would have a very simple Fake News generator. Next I could use that real and fake news to train a classifier and see how well yet another NLP model would be able to classify the real and fake news.

To summarize this repository contains the code for the following 3 steps:
- Train a T5 model on a news dataset and generate a full set with fake news.
- Train a RoBERTA model to be able to classify the real and fake news.
- With an unseen test set first generate fake news with the T5 model and then have the RoBERTa model classify the real and fake news.

As news dataset I used the Tensorflow Datasets ['ag_news_subset'](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/ag_news_subset). It is primarily used for news topic classification but since it contains a 'title' and longer 'description' for 120K news articles it is perfect to use for my fake news generator and detector.

Below a further description of the specific actions you can find in each notebook.
Also note that the subfolder 'fake_news' contains the model weights files for the trained T5 and RoBERTa models. If you want you can just load the models and you don't have to perform the whole training. The generated csv files are also present.

FakeNews_Generator_T5 Notebook:
- Download the 'train' part of the 'ag_news_subset' dataset.
- Split 'ag_news_subset' into a train set with 60K rows and a generate set with 60K rows
- Train the T5 model on the train set.
- Use the 'title' input from the generate set as input for the T5 model to generate a full set with fake news and save as file 't5_generated_fake_news.csv'

FakeNews_Classifier_RoBERTa Notebook:
- Import the previously generated file 't5_generated_fake_news.csv' and preprocess to be used for classification. We want to be able to classify real or fake news.
- Split that dataset into a 80/20 train and validation set.
- Train and validate a RoBERTa base model for classification.

FakeNews_Generator_And_Detector Notebook:
- Download the 'test' part of the 'ag_news_subset'. This dataset contains 7600 rows of data not seen by either the T5 or the RoBERTa model.
- Use the T5 model to generate fake news based on the new 7600 rows. The generated fake news is stored in file 't5_generated_fake_news_final.csv'.
- Use the RoBERTa model to classify all the data and detect what is real or fake news.

During my experiments I used T5-small and T5-base models to train and generate the fake news. All classification was done with a RoBERTa base model.

Fake News generated by the T5-small model could be classified with roughly 99% accuracy.

Fake News generated by the T5-base model could be classified with roughly 97% accuracy.
